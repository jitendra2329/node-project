In Akka, sharding refers to a technique used to distribute and manage actors across
 multiple nodes in a cluster. 
It allows you to scale out the processing capacity of an Akka application by distributing
the workload among multiple actor instances running on different machines.

The idea behind sharding is to partition the actor instances based on a key or identifier.
Each shard represents a subset of the overall actor population, and each shard is responsible 
for processing messages for a specific range or set of keys. By dividing the actors into smaller groups,
you can achieve better scalability and parallelism.
